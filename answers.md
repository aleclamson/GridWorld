Part one
	the bug travles around the outside of the square so a new one each time but repeats
	the bug moves clockwise around the square
	if the bug does not move it would just spin in cirles 
	the bug leaves flowers behind it 
	the bug chnages directions if it is facing a wall 
	the bug chnages directions to avoid the rock
	the bug has the flowers follow directly behind it
	the flowers gets darker the further away the bug gets
	no the rock does not have any behavior 
	no only one object in a space but the bug will pass over the flowers
	it will only move at one space at a time 
	the set color method
