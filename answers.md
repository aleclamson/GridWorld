Part one
	the bug travles around the outside of the square so a new one each time but repeats
	the bug moves clockwise around the square
	if the bug does not move it would just spin in cirles 
	the bug leaves flowers behind it 
	the bug chnages directions if it is facing a wall 
	the bug chnages directions to avoid the rock
	the bug has the flowers follow directly behind it
	the flowers gets darker the further away the bug gets
	no the rock does not have any behavior 
	no only one object in a space but the bug will pass over the flowers
	it will only move at one space at a time 
	the set color method
	the bug is just spinning under the rock
	0    north 
	45   northeast
	90   east
	135  southeast
	180  south
	225  southwest
	270  west
	315  northwest
	360  north
	if you try to move it outside the gird it throws many errors
	set color changes the color
	the bug is gone.
	

 ----------------
 side length is how long the box that the bug made
 steps is how many spaces the or steps the bug has gone
 it has to turn twice to turn the same angle 
 the box bug is in the bug class and the move method extends 
 no it can chnage depending on the code
 it could chnage by chnaging where the class is located 
 the value of zero steps will be zero if no steps will be moved. 
 
---------------------
 you would call on location one as a varrible
 it would be 3, 4
 dir would equal 6, 5
 the ajacent location of the last location 
 you could check each square if the bug is present
 check the grid boundries 
 it could be better to return in an array becuase it would store in a beter way
 three properties of every actor 
 -----------------
 part four .
 bug move 
 bug act 
 and bug color 
 they all have an act a color a pace and a can move
 no they should not over ride the get actos 
 it could read in the actors 
 can move boolean 
 it doesnt need one to run `
